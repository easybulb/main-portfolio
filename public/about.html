        My journey into the world of technology began at the age of 16 in Nigeria, where I started my
career as a computer hardware technician in local cyber cafes. This early exposure not only
sparked my passion for computers but also laid the foundational skills that I have continually
built upon. Since then, I have set my sights on becoming an accomplished Full Stack Developer,
with the capability to build and manage both the front-end and back-end of web applications.</p>
<p>
From my beginnings in hardware, I quickly became fascinated with the creative possibilities of
software. The aspiration to master both ends of development stems from a profound passion for
technology and innovation. Over the years, I have designed and hosted numerous websites
using platforms like WIX, Hostinger, and GoDaddy, each time refining my skills in web design
and functionality.
</p>
<p>A pivotal moment in my journey was the creation of Easybulb, a project that developed smart
lighting solutions controllable via mobile devices. The project allowed me to immerse myself in
the entire product development cycle, from conceptualization to market launch. It required me to
solve complex technical challenges, ensuring that the lighting system was not only functional
but also user-friendly. This innovative solution garnered significant recognition, ultimately
propelling me onto the BBC2 program "Dragons Den," (link to Dragons Den) where I had the
privilege to showcase my product. The success of Easybulb stands as a testament to my
capability to lead significant tech projects from concept to market. My entrepreneurial spirit
drove me to tackle the challenges of merging software and hardware into one seamless user
experience.</p>
<p>What distinguishes me from other candidates is my blend of technical skills and leadership
experience. Having directed three companies, I bring managerial acumen alongside my
technical expertise. My successful integration of various e-commerce and payment gateway
solutions into these platforms further demonstrates my technical proficiency and adaptability.
Whether designing a robust payment system or a mobile-friendly website, I have always aimed
for high-quality solutions that prioritize user experience.</p>
<p>I have completed 5 steps Coding Challenge with ease and it has opened my mind further to my
capabilities and opportunities into the world of computing and programming.
I am applying for the Full Stack Developer Course because I am eager to deepen my technical
skills and advance my career in software development. I believe that this training will enhance</p>
